Rodan + Fields is a leading skincare brand founded in 2000 by Stanford-trained Dermatologists Dr. Katie Rodan and Dr. Kathy Fields with a passion for giving people the best skin of their lives — and the confidence that comes with it.

The company was quickly acquired by the Estée Lauder Companies who placed the R+F skincare Regimens in department stores. In 2007, the doctors made the unprecedented move to leave retail stores and buy the company back. Believing that word-of-mouth is an authentic way to share information about its products, they relaunched Rodan + Fields in 2008 using a Consumer Connected Commerce business model.

Since 2008, the company has grown its innovative line of products and expanded into Canada, Australia and Japan. Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, R+F now employs 500+ people, has more than 300,000 enrolled Independent Consultants and over two million Preferred Customers.

The company is investing significantly in ways to cultivate growth in the global skincare category, including developing product innovations, creating more digital tools for R+F Consultants and reaching untapped audiences in new markets. In the spring of 2018, TPG made a strategic minority investment in Rodan + Fields.

Rodan + Fields skincare philosophy is based on Multi-Med Therapy: The right ingredients in the right formulations in the right order deliver visible results. With its product efficacy and disruptive business model, Rodan + Fields is life-changing skincare.
